I build [products](/portfolio), often working with people who think about design, data, and interactions.

Through my work, I'd like to help stitch the social fabric one smile at a time and help shape the social and market forces that support people with great and enduring ideas.

Other things I enjoy include travel tech, leather crafting, furniture making, cabin building, cold brews, and ramen.

I am currently a software engineer at [Nextdoor](http://nextdoor.com). Feel free to take a gander at [my CV](./cv.pdf), follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/andrewctran), or [see what I'm up to](http://gyrosco.pe/andrewctran).
