						(b.1994) interested in the various ways in which histories and philosophies of science problematize subject-centered conceptualizations of thinking and acting, posing new political and ethical challenges but also serving as means to experiment with alternate modes of relationality and socio-technical organization in modernist avante-gardes. Mostly in conversation with discourses on European modernism, his writing and research concern intersections between literary history and the history of science.
