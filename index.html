						(b.1994) interested in the various ways in which media devices and media systems problematize subject-centered conceptualizations of thinking and acting, posing new political and ethical challenges but also serving as means to experiment with alternate modes of relationality and socio-technical organization in complex ecologies. Mostly in conversation with discourses on media theory/philosophy and critical theory, his writing and research concern twentieth- and twenty-first-century literature, film, and new media with a specialism in the history and theory of self-disclosure.
