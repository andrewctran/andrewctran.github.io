Iâ€™m currently working on Android at [Nextdoor](http://nextdoor.com). My work outside of Nextdoor is what you see here; side projects, open source contributions, and personal itch-scratchers.

## Cabin Porn Chrome Extension
The [Cabin Porn Chrome extension](https://drewtran.com/cabinporn) brings inspiration for your quiet place somewhere to the sanctuary of your new tab page. Get a beautiful cabin every time you open a new tab. Inspired by, but not affiliated with, the work done by the good folks at [Cabin Porn](http://cabinporn.com/) and [Beaver Brook](http://beaverbrook.tumblr.com/).

## Enchord
[Enchord](http://www.enchord.me) is a creative tool for musicians to create, edit, manage, and share chord sheets with one another. It uses a simple and intuitive markup language in order to keep chord sheets formatted exactly the way that you want it to be, regardless of the typeface or font size. Work included implementing a custom markup language that fed into a realtime parser and visualization engine, and crafting a responsive mobile interface suitable for musicians on-the-go. Development was done using a MEAN stack. [Visit the site](http://www.enchord.me).

## Equalize.py
The Internet is becoming increasingly populated with multiparty interactive network applications such as video conferencing, MMORPGs, and online trading. Broadly speaking, a typical shortest-path routing protocol is well-suited to providing network services with low latency connections to their clients. However, in the aforementioned class of applications, clients that are geographically closer to the server have a systematic advantage over those who are farther away. [Equalize](https://drewtran.com/latency-equalization) is a POX controller that allows services to register clients that forward traffic to and from the available servers on routes that significantly reduce latency bias between pairs of clients.
